# Biobank

The [Canadian BioSample Repository](http://biosample.ca) (CBSR) has processed and stored
biospecimens since 2000. In 2008, CBSR began developing a comprehensive client-server Java
application, named BioBank, to be used by nurses, lab technicians, researchers, and lab
administrators.  Biobank allows multiple users, operating at different computers and different
locations, to simultaneously process and log thousands of specimens daily. Nurses can enter
specimens into the system, technicians can process and transfer specimens, researchers can request
specimens and view inventory information, and administrators can create comprehensive queries and
manage users. Biobank is open source and free software, modelled on
[caTissue](http://cbmi.wustl.edu/html/caTissue.html) from the
[National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/).

Biobank is part of a larger effort by the CBSR to create a network for research collaboration, to
facilitate standardization, and to provide help with lab setup, configuration, and training. The
system is flexible and can be adapted for almost any storage application, whether it uses
handwritten labels, barcodes, test tubes, cryovials, or glass slides to label and store specimens.

Currently, CBSR uses Biobank to manage upwards of 480,000 biospecimens and 14,000 patients across 27
studies in dozens of clinics and processing centres around the world (Canada, the United States, and
Europe).
