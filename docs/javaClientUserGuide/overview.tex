\chapter{Overview}
The BioBank2 Java Client is designed to be a client application that connects
to a server which provides services for storing inventory information for
biological samples. More than one client can connect to the server at the same
time. The client is a software application that runs on Microsoft Windows and
Linux\footnote{The scanner cannot be used when using the application on Linux.}. The client
software is a Java application and requires that a Java JRE or JDK be installed
on the computer. The installation program for the client installs a Java JRE if
it is not already present on the computer.

When running on Microsoft Windows, the client can connect to scanners use either
TWAIN\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWAIN}} or
WIA\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Image_Acquisition}}
drivers. Most scanners available on the market provide these
drivers. Therefore, most scanners work with the client software.

Figure \ref{fig:main_window} shows the application's main window and highlights
different some of its components.

\begin{description}
  \item[Window Title Bar] The title bar shows the connection information when
    connected to a BioBank2 server. The domain name or IP address of the server
    is displayed and in square brackets the user name that was used to log in.
  \item[Main Menu] The main menu allows the user access to the different
    functions provided by the software (see section \ref{sec:main_menu} for a
    description of the menu items). The application also has an icon based
    toolbar to access commonly used functions.
  \item[Toolbar Icons] The icon buttons in the toolbar allow quick access to
    often used menu items. Using the mouse, the user can hover over the icon
    button and after 2 seconds a tooltip is displayed describing what the
    button is for and if applicable the keyboard shortcut. Note that there is
    an icon toolbar under the Main Menu and another grouped with the tree view.
  \item[Tree View] The tree view shown here is for the \emph{Administration
    View}. The application uses tree views in the \emph{Administration View}
    and \emph{Processing View} (see section \ref{sec:application_views}). Tree
    view shows nodes in a hierarchical structure. If a node has children a
    \emph{plus} symbol is displayed next to the node. When the symbol is
    pressed the node will expand to show its' child nodes.  Sometimes,
    operations can be performed on certain nodes in the tree by right clicking
    with the mouse on the node.
  \item[Status Bar] The status bar is used to display the current state of the
    application. It is usually updated after the user has completed a task.

    \fbox{Q}} keyboard short cut can be used to perform this function.
\end{description}

\subsection{Administration Menu}
The items under the \emph{Administration} menu allows the user to perform
administration tasks such as: add repository sites, clinics, studies, container
types and containers. Global information such as Sample Types, Source Vessels,
Shipping methods can also be edited. Adding, Editing users and changing user
passwords is also available.

These functions are discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{chap:administration}.

\subsection{Scanner Menu}
These functions are for testing the scanning and decoding parameters in the
preferences (see section \ref{sec:scanning_and_decoding}).
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \scalebox{0.5}
      { \includegraphics*{screenshots/overview/main_menu_scanner} }
      \caption{Scanner menu.}
      \label{fig:main_menu_scanner}
    \end{figure}
\begin{description}
  \item[Scan Plate] Once the scanning regions have been assigned, use this menu
    item to view the image that will be scanned for the plates that were
    defined.
  \item[Decode Plate] Once the decoding parameters have been changed, use this
    menu item to see how well the decoding performs.
\end{description}

\subsection{Search Menu}
The only item under this menu is the \textbf{Search Panel}.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \scalebox{0.5}
      { \includegraphics*{screenshots/overview/main_menu_search} }
      \caption{Search menu.}
      \label{fig:main_menu_search}
    \end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:search_panel} shows the search panel in the Adminstration
view. It is also available in the processing view.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \scalebox{0.5}
      { \includegraphics*{screenshots/overview/search_panel} }
      \caption{Search panel.}
      \label{fig:search_panel}
    \end{figure}
The search panel allows the user to search for any of the following:
\begin{description}
  \item[An inventory ID] each aliquot has a unique identifier referred to as
    the inventory ID. This is the decoded value of the 2D barcode for NUNC
    tubes, the 1D barcode for hair and FTA aliquots, and the 1D barcode for
    Axygen tubes.
  \item[An aliquot Position] each aliquot is stored in a unique position. For
    NUNC tubes it is the well position pre appended with the pallet's labe.
  \item[Non-active aliquots] Aliquots that have been removed from the inventory
    are assigned a \emph{Non Active} activity status. When this search is used
    the list of all aliquots marked as non active is returned.
  \item[A container label] Each container in the inventory has a position
    label. The label uses the labeling scheme defined by the parent label.
  \item[A container's product barcode] Each container in the system has a
    unique product barcode.
  \item[A worksheet] Each patient visit has a unique corresponding worksheet in
    paper form. A patient visit can be searched for using this ID.
\end{description}
When an item is searched for the application will: inform you how many items
were found if there are more than one, or open up a form displaying the
information for the item. If more than one item is found then a form is opened
up for each item.

Fox example when searching for an inventory id the \emph{Aliquot View Form} is
displayed for the aliquot. When searching for a container label, the
\emph{Container view form} is displayed.

\subsection{Configuration Menu}
This menu only contains the preferences item. See Chapter
\ref{chap:configuration} for more details.

\section{Views}
\label{sec:application_views}

The application has been designed with the following views to aid the user in
focusing on a particular high level task. The views are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{Administration View} is used to configure the repository
    site. This deals with the studies and clinics associated with the
    repository sites on the server. Also the view allows the user to configure
    the containers used by the repository sites. See Chapter
    \ref{chap:administration} for more details on this view.
  \item The \textbf{Processing View} deals with accepting patient samples and
    storing the derived aliquots in a repository site. As well, dispatching
    samples between sites can be done with this view. See Chapter
    \ref{chap:processing} for more details on this view.
  \item The \textbf{Reports View} deals with querying information form the
    database. Pre-defined reports can be executed in this view as well as
    allowing the user to create his / her own reports. In addition, the user
    activity logs can also be queried in this view.  See Chapter
    \ref{chap:reports} for more details on this view.
\end{itemize}
