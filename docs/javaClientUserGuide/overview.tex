\chapter{Overview}
The BioBank2 Java Client is designed to be a client application that connects
to a server which provides services for storing inventory information for
biological samples. More than one client can connect to the server at the same
time. The client is a software application that runs on Microsoft Windows and
Linux\footnote{The scanner cannot be used when using the application on Linux.}. The client
software is a Java application and requires that a Java JRE or JDK be installed
on the computer. The installation program for the client installs a Java JRE if
it is not already present on the computer.

When running on Microsoft Windows, the client can connect to scanners use either
TWAIN\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWAIN}} or
WIA\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Image_Acquisition}}
drivers. Most scanners available on the market provide these
drivers. Therefore, most scanners work with the client software.

Figure \ref{fig:main_window} shows the application's main window and highlights
different some of its components.

\begin{description}
  \item[Window Title Bar] The title bar shows the connection information when
    connected to a BioBank2 server. The domain name or IP address of the server
    is displayed and in square brackets the user name that was used to log in.
  \item[Main Menu] The main menu allows the user access to the different
    functions provided by the software (see section \ref{sec:main_menu} for a
    description of the menu items). The application also has an icon based
    toolbar to access commonly used functions.
  \item[Toolbar Icons] The icon buttons in the toolbar allow quick access to
    often used menu items. Using the mouse, the user can hover over the icon
    button and after 2 seconds a tooltip is displayed describing what the
    button is for and if applicable the keyboard shortcut. Note that there is
    an icon toolbar under the Main Menu and another grouped with the tree view.
  \item[Tree View] The tree view shown here is for the \emph{Administration
    View}. The application uses tree views in the \emph{Administration View}
    and \emph{Processing View} (see section \ref{sec:application_views}). Tree
    view shows nodes in a hierarchical structure. If a node has children a
    \emph{plus} symbol is displayed next to the node. When the symbol is
    pressed the node will expand to show its' child nodes.  Sometimes,
    operations can be performed on certain nodes in the tree by right clicking
    with the mouse on the node.
  \item[Status Bar] The status bar is used to display the current state of the
    application. It is usually updated after the user has completed a task.

\section{Main Menu}
\label{sec:main_menu}

\subsection{Server Menu}
The \emph{Server} main menu item allows the user to login or logout from a
server and to quit the application.
    \begin{figure}[H]

      \scalebox{0.5}
      { \includegraphics*{screenshots/overview/main_menu_server} }
      \caption{Server menu.}
      \label{fig:main_menu_server}
    \end{figure}
The items unser the \emph{Server} main menu item are as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[Login] Allows the user to login to a BioBank2 server. On startup and
    when logged out this menu item is enabled. When logged into a server this
    menu item is disabled. Also, the \mbox{\fbox{Ctrl} + \fbox{L}} keyboard
    short cut can be used to perform this function.
  \item[Logout] Allows the user to log out and close the connection to a
    BioBank2 server. On startup this menu item is disabled. The item is enabled
    only when the user has succesfully logged in to a BioBank2 server. Also,
    the \mbox{\fbox{Ctrl} + \fbox{Shift} + \fbox{L}} keyboard short cut can be
    used to perform this function.
  \item[Quit] Shuts down the application. Also, the \mbox{\fbox{Ctrl} +
    \fbox{Q}} keyboard short cut can be used to perform this function.
\end{description}

\subsection{Administration Menu}
The items under the \emph{Administration} menu allows the user to perform
administration tasks such as: add repository sites, clinics, studies, container
types and containers. Global information such as Sample Types, Source Vessels,
Shipping methods can also be edited. Adding, Editing users and changing user
passwords is also available.

These functions are discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{chap:administration}.

      \label{fig:main_menu_administration}
    \end{figure}

\subsection{Processing Menu}
The \emph{Processing} main menu item provides access to the patient processing
functions. These functions are the ones that are used most on a day to day
basis. Please refer to Chapter \ref{chap:processing}.
    \begin{figure}[H]

      \label{fig:main_menu_processing}
    \end{figure}

\subsection{View Menu}
\subsection{Print Menu}
\subsection{Scanner Menu}
These functions are for testing the scanning and decoding parameters in the
preferences (see section \ref{sec:scanning_and_decoding}).

      \caption{Scanner menu.}
      \label{fig:main_menu_scanner}
    \end{figure}
\begin{description}
  \item[Scan Plate] Once the scanning regions have been assigned, use this menu
    item to view the image that will be scanned for the plates that were
    defined.
  \item[Decode Plate] Once the decoding parameters have been changed, use this
    menu item to see how well the decoding performs.
