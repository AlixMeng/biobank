# Client scanning and decoding

The client has the capability to decode [2D Data Matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix)
barcodes located on specimen tubes. The barcodes on many tubes can be decoded at once when they are
placed in a [microwell plate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwell_plate).  Images of microwell
plates captured using a camera or flatbed scanner can be decoded by the client.

## Flatbed scanner configuration

Before a flatbed scanner can be used with the client, configuration is required. Please see the
following link for the instructions:

* [Configuration](client_scanning_and_decoding_configuration.md)

## Decoding images

In the client, decoding of mirowell plate images is possible in the following scenarios:

1. When linking specimens to patients: accessed by selecting **Procesing -> Specimen Link** from the
   main menu when in the processing view (to change to this view select **View -> Open Processing
   View**).

1. When assigning storage locations to specimens: accessed by selecting **Procesing -> Specimen
   Assign** from the main menu when in the processing view.

1. When creating dispatches : accessed by selecting **Processing -> Add Dispatch** from the main
   menu when in the processing view.

1. When processing received dispatches : accessed by selectign a **Receiving** dispatch from the
**Specimen Transit** tab in the processing view.

1. When testing image decoding: accessed by selecting **Scanning and Decoding -> Decode Image** from
   the main menu.
