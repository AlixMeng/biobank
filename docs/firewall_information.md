# Firewall Information

The Biobank thick client needs to communicate with two servers for proper operation.

1. A **Biobank Server**.
2. The **Software Update** server.

The Biobank server is accessed using the *HTTPS protocol* on port *443*.  The software update server is
access using the *HTTP* protocol on port *80*.

For CBSR these servers are:

1. The Biobank Server is at https://biobank.csbr.ualberta.ca/.
2. The Software Update server is at http://aicml-med.cs.ualberta.ca/

Note that depending on the installation, these servers may **not** be the ones used by CBSR.
