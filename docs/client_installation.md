# Biobank client installation

Clients are available for multiple operating systems. Please download the client that matches your
computer's operating system, and the version of the Biobank server you wish to connect to.

The client software for Microsoft Windows is bundled with the correct version of the Java Runtime
Enviroment (JRE) to make the installation simpler.  If you already have Java installed on your
computer, the Biobank client will not overwrite your current Java installation.
