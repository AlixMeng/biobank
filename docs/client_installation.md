# Biobank thick client installation

Clients are available for multiple operating systems. Please download the client that matches your
computer's operating system, and the version of the Biobank server you wish to connect to.

The latest version of the client can be downloaded from here:

* [Biobank v3.8.0](http://aicml-med.cs.ualberta.ca/CBSR/Biobank_v3.8.0/)

If you are connecting to CBSR's Biobank server you have to use the following version:

* [Biobank v3.2.3](http://aicml-med.cs.ualberta.ca/CBSR/BioBank_v3.2.3/)

If you are using a Mac or Linux, you have to manually install the client. After downloading the
client from one of the above links, please follow these instructions:

## Microsoft Windows

Alternatively, Microsoft Windows 7 or XP users can download the installer program. It is bundled
with the matching Java Runtime Enviroment (JRE) to make the installation simpler.  If you already
have Java installed on your computer, the Biobank client will not overwrite your current Java
installation.

Once the file is downloaded, double click on the file and follow the instructions.

have administrator rights, please contact your IT department for assistance._**
