This project is for creating the installer for Biobank.

Requirements:

NSIS (latest version)
Biobank must be exported to a folder

How to create installer:

Copy this directory (NSIS) to your exported biobank directory (BIOBANK_EXPORT_DIR)

Your file structure should look like this: 
.
..
./eclipse
./repository
./nsis

Go to the nsis directory, click right on Biobank.nsi and select compile NSI script.

NSIS will then compile the entire project to the parent directory of BIOBANK_EXPORT_DIR.
The filename of the installer will be Biobank-${VER_MAJOR}${VER_MINOR}.exe.
