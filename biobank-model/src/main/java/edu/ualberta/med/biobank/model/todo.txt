[v] Merge center derived classes into center
[ ] Make a StudyCenter object
[ ] Make (pnumber, study) unique instead of just pnumber
[ ] Rethink OriginInfo and ShipmentInfo
[ ] SendsShipments on clinic was to be replaced with what on ShippingMethod?
[ ] How do contacts work again?
[ ] Dispatch should be StudyCenter <-> StudyCenter
[ ] Requests made for dispatches, clarify this process
[ ] Shipments should now just be Dispatches
[ ] Standardization of HasCreationTime and HasLastModifiedTime
[ ] CollectionType/ProcessingType instead of SourceSpecimen/AliquotedSpecimen?
[ ] Attributes
[ ] Remove "edu.ualberta.med.biobank.model" from all the validation messages... 
	it's just clutter
[ ] Split Membership into StudyMembership and CenterMembership? But then how 
	does a center (or study) control which users can work on a given study? 
	Is that necessary?
[ ] Rename name to description, don't make unique, rename nameShort to name?
[ ] Put validation on interfaces to be shared by DTOs and Data model?
[ ] Watch out for FK.sql-s, renaming columns
[ ] Get rid of activity status in a lot of places?
[ ] Merge ContainerPosition into container and SpecimenPositon into Specimen
	so that changes to position can be tracked as part of the object?
[ ] Think about how to deal with translation of global objects, such as,
	Role, Environment, TubeType, etc.
