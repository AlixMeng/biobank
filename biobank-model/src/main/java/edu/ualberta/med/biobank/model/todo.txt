[v] Merge center derived classes into center
[v] Make a StudyCenter object
[v] Make (pnumber, study) unique instead of just pnumber
[v] *Rethink OriginInfo and ShipmentInfo
[v] SendsShipments on clinic was to be replaced with what on ShippingMethod?
[ ] Seriously consider override the equals and hashcode methods of model objects
    to be based on the natural id (e.g. collection event uses patient & visit
    number).
[ ] For unique strings, hash the string instead.
[v] Make the combination of PE (worksheet, center) or (worksheet, study) unique?
    A: Yes. Done.
[v] Q: should SpecimenProcessingLink be between two SpecimenProcessingNode-s
    so that extra information can be stored on the nodes, not just the link?
    so that processing events can have nodes added to them first with the links
    added later?
    A: Yes. Done as 'SpecimenProcessingEvent' and added a 
    'SpecimenProcessingEventAnnotation' object as well.
[v] Q: consider having only SpecimenProcessingLink and not SpecimenProcessing
	Because why bother with two types of definitions when both can be represented
	by one class?
	A: Yes. Done.
[ ] Reports should be global or center-, study-, or center-study-specific.
[ ] Prefix all report objects with "Report" so it's more clear what objects
 	are involved?
[ ] Make annotation type requirements for specific collection event types and/or
	specimen groups?
[ ] Q: How do contacts work again?
	A: make ContactUsers that function like StudyCenter-s
[v] Q: Who makes StudyCenter-s?
	A: Studies make the link?
[v] Dispatch should be StudyCenter <-> StudyCenter
[v] *Requests made for dispatches, clarify this process
	- requires thinking
[v] Shipments should now just be Dispatches
	- Yes
[v] Specimen will have a originCenter and currentCenter and no originInfo
	[v] Remove OriginInfo
[v] Q: Make SpecimenPosition and ContainerPosition either:
	(1) immutable
	(2) embeddable
	A: Made them immutable but not embeddable so could have constraints
	on the entity, and also because not all specimens and containers will
	have a position.
	[v] Replace Row/Col with a `position` column
	A: yes, done, sorta
[ ] Standardization of HasCreationTime and HasLastModifiedTime
	- Call them HasInsertedAt and HasUpdatedAt to remove ambiguity and 
	[v] add listeners to update the properties
	[ ] override date type to save to a decimal(17,3) or a long or something so
		can have millisecond precision in mysql db
[v] *Specimen CreatedAt vs TimeDrawn, etc.
	Q: Are specimens from an organism and aliquots the result of aliquotting?
	Does "samples" include both? CreatedAt would just be the phyiscal time a
	sample is created/ drawn (e.g. whenever it's put in its tube).
[v] Specimen vs Aliquot objects
	Q: Represent them as the same object?
	A: Yes! Otherwise very complicated doubling of relationships, everywhere.
[ ] CollectionType/ProcessingType instead of SourceSpecimen/AliquotedSpecimen?
	- Yes
[ ] Attributes
	- Yes
	- Consider type validation (e.g. legal options, legal regex, legal range).
	- Consider calling "Annotations"?
	- Share annotations in a pool, per study? Parent studies? (inherit definitions?)
[v] Remove "edu.ualberta.med.biobank.model" from all the validation messages... 
	it's just clutter
	- Yes
[ ] *Split Membership into StudyMembership and CenterMembership? But then how 
	does a center (or study) control which users can work on a given study? 
	Is that necessary?
	A: get more feedback from aaron
	A2: could just have a set of specific studies or default "all studies"
	on the CenterMembership
[v] Rename name to description, don't make unique, rename nameShort to name?
	- Yes
[ ] Put validation on interfaces to be shared by DTOs and Data model?
	- Yes
[ ] Splitting model into abstract classes and then transient methods?
	- Yes, investigate/ try
[ ] Q: put report model objects in subpackage?
	- Yes, for membershipts too? Label printing too?	
[ ] Watch out for FK.sql-s, renaming columns
[v] Get rid of activity status in a lot of places?
	- Yes, replace with either (1) enabled/ disabled (2) active/ inactive (e.g. Study/Center)
	[ ] - SpecimenFlag/Comment thing that is put on a (potentially huge) set of specimens.
		- have a flag from a global list of definied options, with clarifying comment
	which will take the idea of "flagged"
[v] Eliminate old "Shipment" and rename Dispatch to "Shipment"
[v] *Labeling Scheme refactoring?
	- Probably replace "Row Col" with "index"?
[ ] **Think about how to deal with translation of global objects, such as,
	Role, Environment, TubeType, etc.
	A: Possibly _don't_. Just assume that everyone within a server is communicating in
	the same language?
[v] ProcessingEvent <-> Specimen and children
	- Yes, discuessed already
[v] Collection Event types
[v] Q: Sent samples freezer?
	A: create a CenterLocation, and assign the specimens to it
[v] *Think more about differences between Shipment/ Dispatch/ Request because the workflow
	and intent seems quite different.
	Shipment - recording incoming things
	Dispatch - decide and record outgoing things, then incoming
	Request - 
	[x] Perhaps Shipment references a Manifest with specimens and shipment info?
[v] Update boolean primitives to be Boolean objects so can better search by example
[v] *SpecimenType refactoring
[ ] *ContainerType refactoring
[ ] *Think of the SpecimenLog/SpecimenEvent as a list of things being done to specimens,
	not so much as the action being called on them. If 30,000 specimens are thawed, then
	there should be 30,000 events recorded on each of them.
[v] Dispatch containers AND specimens, but then product barcode must be globally unique!
[ ] Global list of tube types, defined however, centers can make their own groups of tube
	types and then have their CT have a list of those
[v] Aaron would like the sample-type restriction to be able to be assigned at any level
	(e.g. freezer, hotel, pallet)
[ ] *Server API should have multiple versions that we support? *shudder*
[v] Specimen should have an amount and unit (e.g. volume, mass, punches remaining?, etc.)?
[v] Specimen-s should have a SpecimenTree for their family, which has the Patient and
	then can have a single CollectionEvent.
[x] Q: Study-s can have an share Protocol-s. Protocol-s could be independently managed or
	owned by a single Study?
	A: too complicated for now, just do Study-s
[v] How to deal with 96 well plates where the wells do not have ids, only the plate does?
	A: fine, but all specimens should still have an inventory id for referencing them,
	whether it's attached or not.
[ ] *How to deal with duplicate ids? Namespaces (e.g. distributer)? Unique per container?
	Q: ask CBSR!!
[ ] Check ValidityAuditStrategy when it comes to ids that are join-table ids, it doesn't 
	seem to update unless not add
* requires thought/ feedback

THOUGHTS ON: ANNOTATIONS

Have an abstract Annotation class with JOINED InheritanceType

For: Patient, CollectionEvent, Specimen, Shipment/Dispatch?

THOUGHTS ON: DYNAMIC-ISH CONTAINER TYPES

- have different naming stategies, e.g. enumerated (just a list) and 2d? Then centers can create
their own naming scheme that uses a (code-based) strategy?
